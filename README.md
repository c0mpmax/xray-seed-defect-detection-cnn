# X-Ray Seed Defect Detection System on CNN

This repository contains the software implementation of a computer vision system for automatic defect detection in X-ray images of seeds.

The system combines semantic segmentation and image classification to identify individual seeds and determine whether each seed is healthy or defective.

The project was developed as part of my Bachelor’s thesis:

**«Creation and Software Implementation of Specialized Algorithms for Defects Detection on X-Ray Images of Seeds»**

It can be applied in:

- agriculture quality control

- industrial inspection

- automated defect detection systems

# Pipeline of application

1) Segmentation (through U-Net)

    * Input: X-ray image of seeds

    * Output: binary **mask** with seed contours

     <em>Figure 2 - Original picture / Mask of seeds generated by U-Net</em>
   </p>

2) Contour Processing & Instance Extraction

    * Contours are detected, filled, and converted into individual seed regions.

    * Each seed is cropped and prepared for classification.

   </p>

3) Classification (MobileNetV2)

    - Each extracted seed is classified as:

        ✅ Healthy

        ❌ Defective

4) Visualization

    * The final image is displayed with bounding boxes:

        🟢 Green — healthy seed
